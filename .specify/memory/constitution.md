# 8Bitten Constitution - The Definitive NES Emulator

## Core Principles

### I. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is mandatory for all code: Tests MUST be written first, approved by stakeholders, fail initially, then implementation follows. The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is strictly enforced. No production code without failing tests first.

**Rationale**: Ensures code quality, prevents regressions, and validates requirements before implementation in an emulator where accuracy is critical.

### II. Component-Based Architecture
Every emulator component (CPU, PPU, APU, Memory, Cartridge) MUST be implemented as independent, testable modules with clear interfaces. Components MUST be self-contained with minimal dependencies.

**Rationale**: NES emulation requires precise component isolation to accurately simulate hardware behavior and enable independent testing of each subsystem.

### III. Performance-First Design
All code MUST prioritize performance and accuracy over convenience. Frame timing, CPU cycle accuracy, and memory access patterns MUST match original NES hardware specifications. Performance regressions are blocking issues.

**Rationale**: Emulation requires real-time performance to maintain 60 FPS and accurate timing for games to function correctly.

### IV. .NET Standard Compliance
All libraries MUST target .NET Standard 2.1 minimum for maximum compatibility. Use modern C# features (nullable reference types, pattern matching, records) where appropriate. Follow Microsoft's C# coding conventions.

**Rationale**: Ensures broad compatibility across .NET implementations while leveraging modern language features for safer, more maintainable code.

### V. Comprehensive Integration Testing
Integration tests MUST cover component interactions, ROM loading, save state functionality, and audio/video output. Focus on end-to-end game compatibility testing with known ROM test suites.

**Rationale**: Emulator correctness depends on proper component interaction; unit tests alone cannot validate the complex timing and state dependencies between NES subsystems.

### VI. Research-Grade Metrics and Analysis (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All emulation operations MUST provide comprehensive, exportable metrics suitable for academic research. Recording and replay functionality MUST achieve perfect determinism. Analysis tools MUST meet scientific rigor standards for reproducible research.

**Rationale**: 8Bitten aims to be the definitive research platform for academics, speedrunners, and competitive gamers, requiring uncompromising data quality and analytical capabilities.

### VII. Universal Accessibility and Excellence
The emulator MUST serve as the gold standard for all user types: academics conducting research, speedrunners optimizing performance, AI researchers training models, and casual gamers seeking authentic experiences. No compromise on quality for any use case.

**Rationale**: By serving all communities with excellence, 8Bitten becomes the universal standard, driving adoption and ensuring long-term sustainability and community support.

## Performance Standards

All code MUST meet these non-negotiable performance requirements:
- Maintain 60 FPS during normal gameplay on target hardware (modern desktop/laptop)
- CPU emulation MUST complete within cycle-accurate timing windows
- Memory access patterns MUST not exceed 2x overhead compared to native access
- Audio buffer underruns MUST not occur during normal operation
- Save state operations MUST complete within 100ms
- Real-time metrics collection MUST not impact emulation performance
- Recording and replay operations MUST maintain cycle-perfect accuracy
- Analysis tools MUST process data without blocking emulation

Performance testing MUST be automated and run on every build. Performance regressions block releases.

## Research and Analysis Standards

All research and analysis features MUST meet academic standards:
- Data export MUST be in standard scientific formats (CSV, JSON, HDF5)
- Metrics MUST be timestamped with sub-frame precision
- Recording MUST achieve 100% deterministic replay
- Statistical analysis MUST provide confidence intervals and error bounds
- Comparison tools MUST identify differences with statistical significance
- All measurements MUST be traceable to hardware reference standards

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Requirements
- All code MUST pass automated tests before review
- Performance benchmarks MUST be included for core emulation components
- Code coverage MUST be maintained above 90% for emulation core
- All public APIs MUST have XML documentation comments

### Quality Gates
1. **Unit Tests**: All new code requires corresponding unit tests
2. **Integration Tests**: Component interactions require integration test coverage
3. **Performance Tests**: Core emulation loops require performance validation
4. **Compatibility Tests**: Changes affecting game compatibility require ROM test validation
5. **Research Validation**: Analysis features require validation against known datasets
6. **Determinism Tests**: Recording/replay features require perfect reproducibility validation
7. **Metrics Accuracy**: All measurements require validation against hardware references

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Any complexity introduced MUST be justified against emulation accuracy requirements.

Amendments require:
1. Documentation of the proposed change and rationale
2. Impact assessment on existing codebase
3. Migration plan for affected components
4. Approval from project maintainers
