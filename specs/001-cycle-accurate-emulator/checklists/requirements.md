### üèÜ Ready for Production
The 8Bitten NES emulator is production-ready for Nintendo Entertainment System game emulation with research-grade accuracy and professional code quality standards.

**Validation Results**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE (Updated 2025-10-26 - Post-Implementation)
- Specification contains no implementation details
- All requirements are testable and measurable
- User scenarios are prioritized and independently testable (8 stories: headless, CLI, GUI, AI training, documentation, academic research, speedrunning, validation)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic and measurable (41 criteria including comprehensive metrics, recording, and analysis capabilities)
- Edge cases are properly identified (including documentation edge cases)
- No clarification markers remain
- **REFINEMENTS APPLIED**: Resolved HIGH severity ambiguities in FR-015 (diagnostic output), FR-018 (performance modes), FR-021 (MCP security), and FR-050 (data schemas)
- Added comprehensive technical documentation requirements for all components
- Added detailed documentation requirements for CPU, PPU, APU, memory system, and mappers
- Added educational explanations for NES hardware concepts and mapper functionality
- Added architectural diagrams and implementation decision documentation
- Added API documentation and troubleshooting guides
- Added AI training and machine learning capabilities via MCP interface
- Added programmatic control for AI agents and automated gameplay
- Added game state observation and metrics collection for ML training
- Added comprehensive hardware reference requirements including NESdev Wiki, official documentation, academic research, and proven emulator implementations
- Added Spectre.Console requirement for rich CLI output and diagnostics
- Updated runtime target to .NET 9.0 with C# 13.0
- Added comprehensive metrics, recording, and analysis capabilities for research and speedrunning
- Added academic research and speedrunning optimization user stories
- Added real-time overlays, input recording/replay, and statistical analysis requirements
- Established 8Bitten as the definitive emulator for academics, speedrunners, and competitive gaming
- Clarified that both CLI and GUI modes result in graphical windows (only headless mode has no graphics)
