**Structure Decision**: Single project architecture with component-based organization optimized for research and analysis. The structure reflects the constitutional requirement for independent, testable modules while maintaining clear separation between core emulation, infrastructure, research tools, and user interfaces. Each major NES component (CPU, PPU, APU) has its own namespace with corresponding test coverage, and dedicated infrastructure for metrics collection, recording, and analysis to support academic research and speedrunning optimization.

## Complexity Tracking

> **No constitutional violations detected** - All design decisions align with constitutional principles.

The implementation plan maintains constitutional compliance through:
- Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Test-driven development workflow with comprehensive test coverage
- Performance-first design with appropriate technology choices
- .NET Standard compliance for maximum compatibility
- Integration testing strategy covering all component interactions
- Research-grade metrics and analysis capabilities
- Universal accessibility serving all user communities with excellence

No complexity justification required.
