# 8Bitten Branching Strategy

**Purpose**: Define a systematic branching strategy for research-grade development with clear feature boundaries, regular commits, and comprehensive documentation.

**Audience**: Development team, contributors, and research collaborators

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-26

## 🎯 **Strategy Overview**

8Bitten uses a **Feature-Driven Development (FDD)** branching strategy optimized for:
- **Research-grade quality** with comprehensive validation
- **Independent feature delivery** enabling parallel development
- **Academic collaboration** with clear contribution pathways
- **Incremental releases** supporting different user communities

## 🌳 **Branch Structure**

### **Main Branches**

```
main (production-ready releases)
├── develop (integration branch for completed features)
├── research (experimental research features)
└── docs (documentation-only changes)
```

### **Feature Branches**

```
feature/
├── 001-headless-execution      # US1: Foundation for all other features
├── 002-cli-gaming             # US2: Graphics and audio output
├── 003-gui-configuration      # US3: User interface and settings
├── 004-ai-ml-platform         # US4: MCP interface and AI integration
├── 005-documentation          # US5: Technical documentation
├── 006-research-analytics     # US6: Academic research tools

├── 008-hardware-validation    # US8: Accuracy testing and validation
└── 009-polish-optimization    # Final polish and cross-cutting concerns
```

### **Component Branches** (within features)

```
feature/001-headless-execution/
├── cpu-implementation         # 6502 processor core
├── ppu-headless              # PPU without graphics output
├── apu-silent                # APU without audio output
├── memory-management         # Memory mapping and cartridge loading
├── timing-coordination       # Cycle-accurate timing system
└── diagnostic-output         # Logging and validation output
```

## 📋 **Branching Rules**

### **Branch Naming Convention**

```
# Feature branches (from tasks.md user stories)
feature/[###]-[kebab-case-description]

# Component branches (within features)
feature/[###]-[feature-name]/[component-name]

# Hotfix branches
hotfix/[issue-number]-[brief-description]

# Research branches
research/[experiment-name]

# Documentation branches
docs/[section-name]
```

### **Branch Lifecycle**

1. **Create**: Branch from `develop` for new features
2. **Develop**: Regular commits with clear messages
3. **Test**: Comprehensive testing before merge
4. **Review**: Code review and constitutional compliance check
5. **Merge**: Merge to `develop` when feature complete
6. **Release**: Merge `develop` to `main` for releases

## 🔄 **Feature Branch Strategy**

### **Rational Feature Sets**

Each feature branch represents a **complete user story** from the specification:

| Branch | User Story | Deliverable | Dependencies |
|--------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| `feature/001-headless-execution` | US1 (P1) | ROM loading and cycle-accurate execution | None (foundation) |
| `feature/002-cli-gaming` | US2 (P2) | Graphics, audio, and input handling | US1 complete |
| `feature/003-gui-configuration` | US3 (P3) | Avalonia UI and settings management | US2 complete |
| `feature/004-ai-ml-platform` | US4 (P4) | MCP interface and AI agent communication | US1 complete |
| `feature/005-documentation` | US5 (P5) | Technical documentation and diagrams | Any feature (parallel) |
| `feature/006-research-analytics` | US6 (P6) | Metrics, recording, and analysis tools | US4 complete |
| `feature/007-speedrun-analysis` | US7 (P7) | Optimization and comparison tools | US6 complete |
| `feature/008-hardware-validation` | US8 (P8) | Test ROMs and accuracy validation | US1 complete |

### **Component Granularity**

Within each feature branch, create **component branches** for:
- **Independent development** of core components (CPU, PPU, APU)
- **Parallel implementation** by multiple developers
- **Isolated testing** of individual components
- **Clear commit history** for each component
